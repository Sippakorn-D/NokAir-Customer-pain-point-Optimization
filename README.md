# Nokair Customer Pain Point Optimization
  I have some project that my professor in Operation Research has told to find an Optimization for some business that i need to find a solution from customer pain point

  So That Is a Origin to making "NokAir Customer Pain Point" Project for Discover "Persona -> PainPoint -> Solution" For making Business Advantaged for the future
  
1. Find Customer Service
   * Awareness
   * Consideration
   * Purchase
   * Pre-Flight
   * In-Flight
   * Post-Flight

2. Find Customer Pain Point  
   * Flight Delay & Flight Canceled
   * Customer Service Waiting
   * Application Overload

3. Make Problem Formulation  
   * Find Parameter
   * Formula  
     * Flight Delay & Flight Canceled -> Poisson Process
     * Customer Service Waiting -> M/M/c Model
     * Application Overload -> M/M/1 Model

4. Solving problem  
   * Expected Variables  
       * Flight Delay & Flight Canceled -> Total Aircraft x P(Objective)  
         When P(Objective) = Total Flight / Max(P(lambda))
       * Customer Service Waiting -> Servers (C) & SLA time (min)
       * Application Overload -> Utillization (pho)

5. Summary Solution
